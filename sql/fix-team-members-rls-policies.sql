-- Fix Team Members RLS Policies for CRUD Operations
-- This script adds missing INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies for team_members table
-- CRITICAL: Allows team member management functionality to work

-- Step 1: Show current RLS policies
SELECT 
    'CURRENT RLS POLICIES' as status,
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'team_members';

-- Step 2: Add missing INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policy for team_members
-- This allows the application to add, edit, and remove team members
CREATE POLICY "Allow insert/update/delete on team_members" ON team_members
    FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Step 3: Verify new policies are created
SELECT 
    'UPDATED RLS POLICIES' as status,
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'team_members';

-- Step 4: Test INSERT operation (this should now work)
-- Note: This is a test - replace with actual team member data if needed
DO $$
DECLARE
    test_team_id INTEGER;
BEGIN
    -- Get a valid team ID for testing
    SELECT id INTO test_team_id FROM teams LIMIT 1;
    
    -- Test INSERT (will rollback at end)
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO team_members (name, hebrew, is_manager, team_id) 
        VALUES ('Test User', '◊û◊©◊™◊û◊© ◊ë◊ì◊ô◊ß◊î', false, test_team_id);
        
        RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ INSERT test successful - RLS policy allows team member creation';
        
        -- Clean up test data
        DELETE FROM team_members WHERE name = 'Test User';
        
    EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
        RAISE NOTICE '‚ùå INSERT test failed: %', SQLERRM;
    END;
END $$;

-- Step 5: Show summary
SELECT 'üéâ Team Members RLS Policies Fixed - CRUD operations now allowed' as result;
