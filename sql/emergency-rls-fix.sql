-- EMERGENCY RLS FIX: Restore schedule_entries write permissions
-- ISSUE: Performance optimization migrations dropped INSERT/UPDATE policies
-- IMPACT: Users cannot update schedules - getting RLS policy violations
-- FIX: Recreate the missing policy that was accidentally dropped

-- PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY UNBLOCK (Run this first)
-- =============================================================================

-- Check current policies (diagnostic)

CREATE POLICY "emergency_schedule_access" ON schedule_entries
    FOR ALL 
    USING (true)

SELECT '‚úÖ EMERGENCY FIX APPLIED - Schedule updates should work now' as status;

-- =============================================================================
-- PHASE 2: RESTORE PROPER POLICY (Run after confirming emergency fix works)
-- =============================================================================

-- Remove emergency policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "emergency_schedule_access" ON schedule_entries;

-- Recreate the proper policy that was accidentally dropped in performance migrations
-- This matches the original schema.sql policy that was working before
