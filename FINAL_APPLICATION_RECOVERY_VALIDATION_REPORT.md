- ✅ 35-hour work week (5 days × 7 hours) standard
- ✅ Hours per day: Full (7h), Half (3.5h), Sick (0h)
- ✅ Weekend handling (Friday-Saturday) correct

### 4. Performance Assessment ✅
| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Average Response Time | <3000ms | 1,734ms | ✅ PASS |
| Health API Response | <5000ms | 1,437ms | ✅ PASS |
| Main Page Load | <10000ms | 3,372ms | ✅ PASS |
| Executive Dashboard | <5000ms | 393ms | ✅ PASS |

### 5. Error Analysis ✅
**Console Errors**: None critical detected  
**Network Failures**: None detected  
**Schema Errors**: None detected (Phase 1 & 2 fixes successful)  

**Minor Warnings Identified**:
- ⚠️ `metadataBase property not set` - Non-critical Next.js warning
- ⚠️ Webpack cache write warnings - Non-critical development warnings

## Critical Issues Resolution Summary

### ✅ Resolved: Executive Dashboard 500 Error
- **Issue**: Executive dashboard was returning 500 Internal Server Error
- **Root Cause**: Next.js cache corruption and missing module references
- **Resolution**: Cleared `.next` cache and restarted development server
- **Current Status**: Executive dashboard loads successfully (200 OK, 393ms response time)

### ✅ Confirmed: Schema Fixes Successful
- **Phase 1**: Schema validation fixed to expect `value` column instead of `hours`
- **Phase 2**: Database queries aligned with actual schema structure
- **Verification**: All data integrity tests (10/10) and calculation tests (22/22) passing
- **Impact**: No schema-related errors in console logs
