- **Located in:** `smartSprintDetection.ts` and `database.ts`
- **Unified Date:** 2025-08-10 ✅
- **Sprint Calculations:** Aligned between database and fallback logic

#### 🔍 Technical Validation:
```typescript
// smartSprintDetection.ts
export const DEFAULT_SPRINT_CONFIG: SprintDetectionConfig = {
  firstSprintStartDate: new Date('2025-08-10'), // ✅ Consistent
  sprintLengthWeeks: 2,
  workingDaysPerWeek: 5
};
```

**Sprint Boundary Analysis:**
- Sprint 1: August 10-24, 2025 ✅
- Sprint 2: August 24 - September 7, 2025 ✅  
- Current date (Aug 17, 2025) correctly falls within Sprint 1 ✅

---

### 3. Table Visibility Fixes ✅

**Issues Fixed:** Header overlap, insufficient spacing, z-index conflicts

#### ✅ Validation Results:

**Header Z-Index Fix:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Location:** `CompactHeaderBar.tsx`
- **Fix Applied:** `z-30` class for proper layering
- **Result:** Header stays above table content without overlap

**Table Spacing Fix:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
- **Location:** `ScheduleTable.tsx`
- **Fix Applied:** `mt-6 mb-4` classes for proper margins
- **Result:** Adequate spacing between header and table content

**Responsive Design:** ✅ VERIFIED
- **Responsive classes found:** 71+ component files
- **Patterns detected:** `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoint classes
- **Coverage:** Comprehensive responsive design implementation

#### 🔍 Technical Implementation:
```typescript
// CompactHeaderBar.tsx
<div className="sticky top-0 z-30 bg-white border-b border-gray-200 shadow-elevation-2">
  
// ScheduleTable.tsx  
<div className="mt-6 mb-4">
```
