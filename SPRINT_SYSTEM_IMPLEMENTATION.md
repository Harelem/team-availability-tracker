## 🔧 Git Workflow Strategy

```bash
# Main development branches
main                    # Production-ready code
develop                 # Integration branch for features
feature/sprint-system   # Main feature branch

# Individual feature branches
feature/database-schema
feature/sprint-logic
feature/coo-dashboard
feature/mobile-ui
feature/performance
```
