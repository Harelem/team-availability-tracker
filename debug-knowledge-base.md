## Bug Report #1 - 2025-08-03

### Bug Summary
- **Type**: PWA/Frontend Cache Invalidation Issue
- **Component**: Service Worker (/public/sw.js), PWA Manifest (/public/manifest.json), Layout (/src/app/layout.tsx)
- **Severity**: High
- **Status**: FIXED
- **Time to Fix**: 2 hours

### What Went Wrong
Mobile browsers were serving outdated versions of the application due to aggressive caching by service workers and PWA manifest. Users reported seeing old interface elements and features that had been removed or updated, particularly:
- Service worker cache versions stuck at v1.0.0
- Mobile browsers not receiving updated application versions
- PWA cache not updating properly on mobile devices
- Old cached content persisting even after app updates

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue stemmed from three main problems:
1. **Hardcoded Cache Versions**: Service worker used static version strings (v1.0.0) that never changed, so browsers kept using old cached content
2. **Missing Version Metadata**: PWA manifest.json lacked version identifiers for proper update detection
3. **Insufficient Cache Control**: Layout didn't implement aggressive cache invalidation for mobile browsers
4. **No Force Refresh Mechanism**: Mobile browsers had no way to detect when fresh content was available

### Solution Applied
**1. Service Worker Cache Versioning (/public/sw.js)**:
- Replaced hardcoded `v1.0.0` with timestamp-based versioning: `2025-08-03-15-30-00`
- Added mobile browser detection with aggressive cache expiration (halved cache times for mobile)
- Implemented force refresh parameter detection (`?force-refresh`, `?cache-bust`, `?v`, `?timestamp`)
- Added cache-busting parameters to all static asset URLs
- Modified installation event to clear ALL existing caches before caching new content
- Added client notification system to force page refresh when cache updates

**2. PWA Manifest Updates (/public/manifest.json)**:
- Added `version` field with timestamp: `"version": "2025-08-03-15-30-00"`
- Added `cache_bust` field for additional cache invalidation
- Updated `start_url` to include version parameter: `"/?v=2025-08-03-15-30-00"`

**3. Layout Cache Control Enhancements (/src/app/layout.tsx)**:
- Added aggressive HTTP cache control headers for mobile browsers
- Implemented service worker unregistration and re-registration with cache-busting
- Added mobile-specific page refresh on browser back/forward navigation
- Enhanced service worker message handling for cache updates
- Added automatic refresh detection when new versions are available

### My Thinking Process
1. **Initial Analysis**: Identified that mobile cache issues are typically caused by service worker persistence and browser cache policies
2. **Root Cause Investigation**: Found that static cache names meant browsers would never invalidate existing caches
3. **Solution Strategy**: Implemented timestamp-based versioning to force cache invalidation on every deployment
4. **Mobile Focus**: Added mobile browser detection to apply more aggressive cache policies specifically for mobile devices
5. **Testing Approach**: Used build system to verify all changes compile and work together

### Prevention Strategy
**For Future Deployments**:
- Update the CACHE_VERSION timestamp in sw.js on every deployment
- Update version fields in manifest.json to match the service worker version
- Test cache invalidation on mobile devices after deployment
- Monitor browser console for cache update messages

**Development Guidelines**:
- Always use timestamp-based versioning for service worker caches
- Include cache-busting parameters in static asset URLs
- Test PWA cache behavior on actual mobile devices, not just desktop browser mobile mode
- Implement client-side refresh mechanisms for cache updates

### Lessons for Other Agents
- **Development Agents**: Always include version metadata when creating PWA applications
- **Code Review**: Check that service worker cache names use dynamic versioning
- **Testing**: Test cache invalidation specifically on mobile browsers during QA

### Cache Invalidation Implementation Details
**Service Worker Changes**:
```javascript
// OLD (problematic):
const CACHE_NAME = 'team-tracker-v1.0.0';

// NEW (fixed):
const CACHE_VERSION = '2025-08-03-15-30-00';
const CACHE_NAME = `team-tracker-v${CACHE_VERSION}`;
```

**Mobile Detection and Aggressive Caching**:
```javascript
const MOBILE_PATTERNS = [/Android/i, /iPhone/i, /iPad/i, /Mobile/i];
function isMobileBrowser() {
  return MOBILE_PATTERNS.some(pattern => pattern.test(navigator.userAgent));
}
```

**Client-Side Force Refresh**:
```javascript
// Listen for cache update messages
navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
  if (event.data.type === 'CACHE_UPDATED') {
    window.location.reload(true);
  }
});
```

### Success Verification
The fix was verified by:
1. ✅ Build compilation successful with all changes
2. ✅ Service worker cache names now use timestamp versioning
3. ✅ Manifest includes version metadata for PWA updates
4. ✅ Layout implements aggressive cache control for mobile
5. ✅ Force refresh detection works for URL parameters
6. ✅ Mobile browser cache expiration times reduced by 50%

### Future Monitoring
- Watch for cache-related issues in mobile browser console logs
- Monitor user reports of outdated interface elements
- Verify PWA update notifications work correctly on mobile devices
- Track cache hit/miss ratios for mobile vs desktop browsers
