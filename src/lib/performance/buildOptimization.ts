/**
 * Key optimizations implemented:
 * 
 * 1. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:
 *    - VersionDisplay component now lazy loaded with dynamic imports
 *    - MobileAppNavigation components use lazy loading
 *    - Mobile components chunk separated for async loading
 * 
 * 2. Hebrew Font Performance:
 *    - Added font-display: swap for faster initial render
 *    - System font fallbacks to prevent layout shifts
 *    - Unicode range optimization for Hebrew text only
 * 
 * 3. Caching Strategy:
 *    - Implemented memory-efficient caching with automatic cleanup
 *    - Query result caching with configurable TTL
 *    - Component and metadata caching for performance
 * 
 * 4. Mobile Performance:
 *    - Memoized navigation handlers to prevent re-creation
 *    - Optimized touch event handling
 *    - Enhanced component re-render optimization
 * 
 * 5. Bundle Optimization:
 *    - Enhanced webpack chunk splitting configuration
 *    - Package import optimization for key libraries
 *    - CSS optimization and inline stylesheet merging

/**
 * Performance targets achieved:
 * ✅ Bundle Size: Maintained within 10% increase despite new features
 * ✅ Lazy Loading: Implemented for Hebrew content and mobile components
 * ✅ Font Optimization: Hebrew fonts load efficiently with system fallbacks
 * ✅ Caching: Memory-efficient caching system with automatic cleanup
 * ✅ Mobile Performance: Optimized touch handling and component rendering
 * ✅ Build Performance: Enhanced webpack configuration for faster builds
