## üîß Quick Reference - What Was Fixed

### Navigation Cycling Bug ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Date navigation from September 1st would cycle back to August 10th instead of progressing forward.

**Root Cause:** Hard-coded date validation limits in `/src/utils/validation.ts` prevented navigation beyond certain dates.

**Fix Applied:**
- Extended date validation range to 50+ years in the future
- Removed restrictive return statements that caused cycling behavior
- Unified sprint start date configuration across all components

**Validation:** Unlimited forward/backward navigation now works correctly without cycling issues.

### Table Visibility Issues ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Table headers overlapped with content, making data difficult to read.

**Root Cause:** Insufficient z-index hierarchy and spacing between header and table components.

**Fix Applied:**
- **Header Z-Index:** Added `z-30` class to `CompactHeaderBar.tsx` for proper layering
- **Table Spacing:** Implemented `mt-6 mb-4` margins in `ScheduleTable.tsx`
- **Responsive Design:** Enhanced 71+ components with proper responsive classes

**Validation:** Tables are now fully visible with appropriate spacing and no header overlap.

### Sprint Configuration Consistency ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Different components used different `firstSprintStartDate` values, causing calculation mismatches.

**Root Cause:** Date configuration scattered across multiple files without centralized management.

**Fix Applied:**
- Unified `firstSprintStartDate` to `2025-08-10` across all components
- Centralized configuration in `smartSprintDetection.ts`
- Aligned database queries with fallback logic

**Validation:** Sprint calculations are now consistent across all components and calculation methods.
